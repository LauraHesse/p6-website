# Project Overview / Javascript-testing

This application reads RSS feeds.

### Description
> In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.
> The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing,
> they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test
> suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and
> we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where
> you come in.
